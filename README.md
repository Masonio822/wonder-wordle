# Wordle Wonder

This is a very simple project I made on a road trip. It filters words based on clues supplied by the user as a middleman 
between the [NYT Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and guesses what the days word is.

## How to use
Download the latest release jar and run it. You will need to have Java 23 or higher installed on your system. 
It can be downloaded [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk23-archive-downloads.html).
Input the first word the generate gives you to the offical wordle page. According to the output, 
click on the boxes underneath the letters of the word to give the generator feedback.
Clicking on the box while gray will turn it green, and clicking it again will turn it yellow.
